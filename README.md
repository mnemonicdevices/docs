# documentation

This repository contains all `mnemonic devices` documentation. It is built with `ruby`, `jekyll`, `bundler` and `just-the-docs`. 

## Building and previewing locally

Assuming, [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) (Currently using an older version due to serverless configuration restrictions), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) are installed on your computer:

1.  Fork or clone this repository. Change your working directory to the root directory of this repository.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

    The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.

## Contributing

Contributions from the community are welcome. All contributions must be approved before being merged into the main branch and subsequently deployed to the server environment.
