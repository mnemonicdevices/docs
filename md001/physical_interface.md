# Physical Interface

Junipers interface was designed for it to be placed in a controller case, with the buttons more accessible allowing for increased immediacy. The top row of input jacks are inputs and the second and third rows are output jacks. The output jacks are indexed from left to right. There are two universal buttons, the `SELECT` and clickable `ROTARY ENCODER` buttons and 8 channel / parameter `LED buttons`.
