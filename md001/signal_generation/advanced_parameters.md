# Advanced Parameters

The following advanced parameters or functions are currently available:

## Recorder

A recorder is available for each channel, streaming directly to the SD Card allowing for very large record durations. There are four "Record States": `Stop`, `Rec`, `Play` and `Overdub`.

Recordings are time-quantized to bar within a 4/4 time signature. The total record duration is determined by the BPM at the initial moment of recording, any further adjustments of BPM are ignored by the recorder. It is possible to manually trigger the Record State or from either an internal or external source.

When configuring the recorder, the following is available:

- Number of bars as given by a 4/4 time signature.
    - `DYN`: Dynamic length recording. Record for as long as desired, then end the recording to the nearest quantized 4/4 bar. (The record length is restricted by whichever is smaller; 65536 bars or the free space of the SD Card).
    - `0-999`: A predetermined bar length. (For recordings longer than 999 bars, use the `DYN` record length).
- `Play / Stop` Trigger - which will begin or stop playback
- `Record / Dub` Trigger - which can begin recording or overdubbing
- `Play / Stop` Edge - `FAL` falling, `RIS` rising or `ANY` rising or falling
- `Record / Dub` Edge - `FAL` falling, `RIS` rising or `ANY` rising or falling
- Playback mode
    - `CON`: Continuous playback mode, will automatically begin playback after recording and continually loop playback until stopped
    - `SGL`: Single shot mode, will play only when requested and only once, after playback is complete the recorder returns to the `Stop` state.


### Recorder Links

Recorder Links allow multiple Recorders on different channels behave as one. This is helpful when wanting to record multiple signals simultaneously, for example, both trigger and v/oct channels of a keyboard. Recorder links are configurable via the [Global Menu -> Recorder Links](/md001/graphic_interfaces/global_menu.html) menu. There can be up to 4 Links in total.

| NOTE: When a recorder joins a Link, then the state of the Recorders within the Link and the newly assigned Recorder will reset to their default states.

## Sample and Hold

The Sample and Hold advanced function allows an external signal to pass through a configured threshold to sample the signal for a desired period of time on a given channel.

There are two modes available which change the functionality of this feature:
 - Sample and Hold (S&H)
 - Track and Hold (T&H)

Both operate under the same configuration and concept, except that the `S&H` will hold and release the channel value on two subsequent _triggers_ from the incoming signal beyond a given threshold value, while the `T&H` will hold the channel value during a _gate_ from the incoming signal beyond a given threshold value.

The `S&H` generally will create the classic stair-stepped output, stepping from one value to the next on each trigger, while the `T&H` will interrupt a signal and hold it for a period of time, splicing in constant periods with the original signal.

## Quantizer

{: .label .label-yellow }
This feature and documentation is currently under development

The quantizer provides V/octave quantization of the instantaneous channel signal to a given note. Currently chromatic, major and minor triads can be selected. When enabled the `amplitude` primary function will be displayed in octaves and the quantized note value will be displayed.

|__NOTE__: Additional improvements to the quantizer are scheduled for a future release, including custom scales and improved modulation capability.

<hr />

## Wavefolder

The wavefolder advanced function folds a channels signal back onto itself at beyond a given threshold. When signal extends beyond this threshold, the signal is mirrored back onto itself.

The threshold amount is configured by the wavefolder parameter, a value of `Off` disables the wavefolder, a value of `0%` means that if a signal goes beyond the full amplitude range it will begin to be folded, `25%` means that if a signal goes beyond 75% of the full amplitude range it begins to fold, `50%` means that if a signal goes beyond half of the full amplitude range it will begin to be folded and so on.

During the folding process the frequency components will naturally increase as the wavelength of the signal is decreased.

The modulation options for the wavefolder allow for the threshold to be modulated.

|ðŸ’¡ TIP: Wavefolder distortion generally does not respond well with square waves, in order to have it respond, try applying amplitude or offset modulation
