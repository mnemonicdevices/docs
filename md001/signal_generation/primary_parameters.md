# Primary Parameters

The primary parameters are listed below, these are the building blocks for manipulating the waveshape. Each of the primary parameters [can be modulated](/md001/signal_generation/modulation.html) in various ways with respect to the output of other internal channels, as well as CV inputs.

## Waveform

Adjust the waveform of the given channel. The available waveforms are listed in the table below:


| Waveform                  | Description           | Morph To/Fn.      | Image |

## Frequency

Adjusts the `Frequency` of the given channel. Frequency can either be `Synchronized` (relative to the BPM) or `Desynchronized`. When synchronized the maximum and minimum frequencies are `BPM * 128` and `BPM / 128` respectively and when desynchronized they are `128Hz` and `1mHz`. When operating in `Trigger Mode` and `Desynchronized` the unit changes to seconds. 

The frequency is disabled in certain circumstances:

- When the `Input` or `Output` waveform is selected

| ðŸ’¡ _LONG HOLD_ **FREQ** - to switch between `Synchronized` or `Desychronized` modes

### Settings

- [Curve Modulation Settings](/md001/signal_generation/modulation.html#curve-modulation-settings)
- `Synchronize` or `Desynchronized`

<hr />

## Amplitude

Adjusts the `Amplitude` of a given channel. When in `Bipolar` or `Polar` modes the amplitude range is `10Vpp (-5.0V to +5.0V)` or `5Vpp (0.0V to +5.0V)` respectively. The amplitude can go into negative which inverts the signal. This feature also is applied to the modulation, but can be configured.

### Settings

- [Curve Modulation Settings](/md001/signal_generation/modulation.html#curve-modulation-settings)
- Inversion Modulation
    - `POS`: Positive modulation only - modulation output will range from 0% to 100%. No inversion is applied.
    - `INV`: Inversion modulation - allows the modulation output to range from -100% to 100%, in which inversion can be applied.
- `Bipolar` / `Unipolar` mode

<hr />

## Offset

Adjusts the `Offset` of a given channel. At a value of 0 there is no offset being applied, e.g. the waveform is generated within the middle of the amplitude range. At a value of +50 the waveform is generated at the top of the amplitude range, and a value of -50 the waveform is generated at the bottom of the amplitude range.

### Settings

- [Curve Modulation Settings](/md001/signal_generation/modulation.html#curve-modulation-settings)

<hr />

## Morph

The `Morph` parameter varies depending on the waveform and adjusts the shape of the waveform accordingly. See the above waveform table for details about how the morph effects each waveform shape.

| ðŸ’¡ _LONG HOLD_ **MOR** - to switch between morph components (currently only for `Random` and `Envelope` waveforms)

### Settings

- [Curve Modulation Settings](/md001/signal_generation/modulation.html#curve-modulation-settings)
- Mod selector (only available for `Mix`)

### In & Out: Mix

The `Mix` parameter is available when using the `In` or `Out` waveforms and is accessible via the `Morph` parameter button. `Mix` allows mixing between the different waveforms available - mixing between adjacent sources. The horizontal bar indicates the amount of mixing between the currently selected source, and the neighboring source. 

For example when using the `In` waveform, and you have `CV2` selected, when the horizontal bar is toward the left, then you are mixing toward `CV1`, when the horizontal bar is toward the right then you are mixing toward `CV3`, when no horizontal bar is present then no mixing is taking place.

### Envelope: Attack, Skew and Decay

The `Attack`, `Skew` and `Decay` parameters are available when using the `Env` waveform and are accessible by using via the `Morph` parameter button. These parameters control the envelope characteristics.

    </div>
</div>



### Random: Slew and Blend

The `Slew` and `Blend` parameters are available when using the `Random` waveform. `Slew` changes the duration between randomly generated values, while `Blend` mixes between the last random value and an entirely new random value.

<hr />

## Phase

The `Phase` parameter allows periodic waveforms to be phase locked to varying degrees, or not locked at all. When the phase is locked any adjustment to frequency will cause the phase to be recalculated (this can cause visual discontinuities in the waveform which is normal). 

The phase is disabled in certain circumstances:

- When `Frequency` modulation is active
- When the `Input` or `Output` waveform is selected

### Settings

- [Curve Modulation Settings](/md001/signal_generation/modulation.html#curve-modulation-settings)
- Trigger Source: Will reset the Phase of a channel. In `Continuous mode` this will only have an effect when `Phase` is set to `Free`
- `Continuous` or `One-shot` mode: When in `Continuous` the waveform repeats, e.g. an LFO. In `One-shot`, it plays once and stops, e.g. Function generator.
