# Bug report

Sometimes unexpected software issues can occur - In the event of a crash or fault, a log file `dump.txt` will be written to the SD Card. This log file will have useful information for finding the problem. Please send an email to [support@mnemonicdevices.io](mailto:support@mnemonicdevices.io) with this log file, along with all other configuration files on the SD card and a description of what you were doing to produce the bug, please also include the `revision` of the device (which is found on the back of the device) and the firmware `version` you were using.

If the bug persists upon reboot, its likely that the configuration files stored on the SD card are re-triggering the issue. 
You can safely delete the files on the SD card, this will clean the state out and the device should then be able to boot normally.
