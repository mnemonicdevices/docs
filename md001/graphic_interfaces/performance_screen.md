# Performance Screen

{: .label .label-yellow }
This feature and documentation is currently under development   

The Performance interfaces allow for easier and faster ways to perform certain actions. The oscilloscope view is split into 8 so it can display all 8 channels simultaneously.
A small indicator **âŒŸ** next to each channel oscilloscope highlights if the channel has a [Recorder Link](/md001/signal_generation/advanced_parameters.html#recorder-links) connected to the current channel. If so, then using Gin or triggering a recording or playback will affect this channel.
This enables the user to see which channels are being recorded simultaneously. Additionally the user can record state slot changes utilizing the quick-slots mentioned below.

## Mutes

Allows the user to quickly perform mutes of the 8 output channels with the 8 respective channel buttons.

## State quick slots

Providing quick slots have been assigned, they can be recalled by simply processing one of the 8 channel buttons.
