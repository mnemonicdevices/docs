MD-004 Tonic is a 4HP expander for MD-001 Juniper completing the Juniper, Gin and Tonic trio. It provides a full octave keyboard, advanced quantization options and ease-of-use transposition for live performance.

Transpositions supported include semi-tone, whole-tone, minor 3rd, major 3rd, perfect 4th, perfect 5th and octave. These transpositions can be either chromatic or diatonic. Tonic also supports a Live mode in which the root note can be shifted by any desired number of semitones.

Tonic, powered by Juniper allows interesting quantized arpeggio patterns using the LFO shaping features of Juniper, furthermore Juniper can record and playback these transpositions and scale changes on the fly.

Juniper, Gin and Tonic work in harmony to provide a wide gamut of modulation and quantization possibilities for the Eurorack modular synthesizer.
